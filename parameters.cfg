[common]
GESTURE_THRESHOLD = 10 ; SAME VALUR FOR MOTHER
REACH_THRESHOLD = 8 ; SAME VALUE FOR MOTHER
paramTimer1 = 25 ; SAME VALUE FOR MOTHER; thresholds timer1; used to transition between states reset_arm and end
paramTimer2 = 12 ; SAME VALUE FOR MOTHER; thresholds timer2; used as blank time before new scene file load in animation script
paramContactThreshold = 0.4 ; SAME VALUE FOR MOTHER; if his wrist is within 0.4 units of motherWrist, its 'contact' / 'pull'
paramEpNum = 10 ; SAME VALUE FOR MOTHER; runs 10 episodes

[babySpecific]
paramBabyWalkInc = 0.2 ; he walks linearly for now, can be updated; he moves this many units in x-plane every ts
paramBabyRecThreshold = 0.1 ; babys threshold for recognizing mother response; she moves >0.1, he 'knows'
paramBabyIKReach = 10 ; divider before sending motor commands to IK solver; exponential, will want to change...
paramBabyIKPull = 10 ; for now, separate than above, only for flexibility if need be
paramRWInc = 1 ; learning increment
paramBabyGestThreshold = 0.8 ; when he can 'gesture' in future episodes

[motherSpecific]
paramMotherIntThreshold = 12 ; signals at what point RNN-integrator reaches threshold; an 'rnn-mediated response'
paramMotherIntIncPull = 0.2 ; haptic input; inc of increase in intActivity during pulling; note 'during watching' is computed directly from RNN
paramMotherIKReach1 = 10 ; divider before sending motor commands to IK solver; exponential, will want to change...
paramMotherIKReach2 = 5 ; results in quicker than above, for 'mid-pull recognition response' in mother; stylistic only
paramMotherIKWalk = 13 ; divider before sending motor commands to IK solver; exponential, will want to change...
paramMotherStandDist = 4 ; Mother will walk to a point 4 units in front of center of babys head
